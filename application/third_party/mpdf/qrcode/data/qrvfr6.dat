Mostly-free OCR B
 
This font is used in UPC bar code symbols, including the ISBN symbols on
most published books.

A freely distributable version seems to be sorely needed.  Until now, it's
been very difficult to find the font in computer-usable format except by
paying a high fee to a commercial font vendor.  Even many serious commercial
publishers have so much trouble getting it right that they just go ahead and
use Helvetica instead, or even (shudder) Arial.  Since the OCR B font is
required by an international standard, it seems like it ought to be free. 
So here it is.  The font in this package is not a "ripped", pirated, or
shadily reverse engineered version; every effort has been made to ensure
that it genuinely derives from free sources and all the creators involved
have actually intended it for free public use.

The Metafont files (not included - see notes below) were coded by Norbert
Schwarz in the 1980s, based on German standards documents.  He has attached
a notice, notably not actually claiming any copyright - see the file
"ocrbinfo" - saying that the fonts are "given to free non commercial use",
but commenting that he is only free to grant rights to his own work on the
digitization, because he did not design the original letter forms.  He
suggests that there may be other copyright claims attached to the letter
forms themselves, which Schwarz credits as being originally designed by
